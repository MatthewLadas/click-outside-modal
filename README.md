# click-outside-modal

This project aims to practice what I’ve recently learned in JavaScript. I’ll be adding HTML and CSS starter files as the project’s goal is to focus solely on JS.

I’ll be using this Click Outside Modal to re-enforce my knowledge on using different Data Types, Functions including Scope, Hoisting and Closures, The DOM, Switch Statements and Events.
